	 * What is a Graph?

	   - It is a non-linear data structure used for storing data.
	   - It is a set of vertices and a collection of edges that connects a pair 
	     of vertices
	 
	 * In below example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are the Vertex of Graph and each line 
	 * connecting them is called as Edge

                  vertex --> [[1]]------[[2]]
                               |\         \  
                               | \         \ -----> edge
                               |  \       [[5]]
                               |   \     /
                  vertex --> [[3]]--[[4]]

	 * If Ali (vertex) is friend (edge) to Yusuf (vertex), than Yusuf (vertex) is
	 * also friend (edge) to Ali

     * So this socail networking graph can be seen as an undirected graph where
     * edges are undirected. The don't have any direction moving ahead. So, graph
     * can be represented by a two dimensional array, which is nothing but matrix.
