	 * What is a Graph?

	   - It is a non-linear data structure used for storing data.
	   - It is a set of vertices and a collection of edges that connects a pair 
	     of vertices
	 
	 * In below example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are the Vertex of Graph and each line 
	 * connecting them is called as Edge

                  vertex --> [[1]]------[[2]]
                               |\         \  
                               | \         \ -----> edge
                               |  \       [[5]]
                               |   \     /
                  vertex --> [[3]]--[[4]]

     * Graphs help us to implement Socail Networking sites such as, Facebook,
     * Twitter etc. It can be called as Social Networking graph.
     * Names of people represent vertices of Graph.
     * Friendship between two people can be represented as an Edge of Graph.
