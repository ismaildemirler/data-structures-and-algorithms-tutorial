		 * Asymptotic Analysis of An Algorithm

		 * that how much exact time an algorithm is taking or how much space in numbers an algorithm is taking. So usually
		 * there are mathematical models which helps us in determining the time and space complexity of an algorithm. 
		 * Analysis which deals with those mathematical models we term them as asymptotic analysis.
		 * 
		 * So what do we mean by asymptotic analysis?
	       - Asymptotic analysis helps in evaluating performance of an algorithm in terms of input size and it's increase.
	       - Using asymptotic analysis, we don't measure actual running time of algorithm. It helps in determining how much
	       	 time and space taken by algorithm increases with input size.
	       - When we perform the analysis, there are certain notations which we need to know to perform the asymptotic analysis.

		 * Asymptotic Notations
		 * 
		 * Asymptotic analysis helps in evaluating performance of an algorithm in terms of input size and it's increase. 
		 * So usually this asymptotic analysis  is being done by asymptotic notations. 
		 * 
		 * So what do we mean by asymptotic notations?
	       - Asymptotic Notations are the mathematical tools used to describe the running time of an algorithm in term of 
	         input size.
	       - For better understanding let's consider an example: Performance of car in 1 litre of petrol.
	         Let's say you go to a car showroom where you want to purchase a car, so the mostly you will look into the design 
	         of the car and to the salesman, you will ask, what is the performance of car in 1 litre of petrol? How much the 
	         car travels by using 1 litre of petrol? So basically, the salesman will never give you an exact answer, he will
	         simply give you the numbers based on certain conditions the car is running. So he will simply tell you that if 
	         you are running this car on a highway where the traffic is very minimum, this car can give you a mileage of 25 
	         kilometers per litre. And if you are running it in the city where the traffic is maximum, it will give you 15 
	         kilometers per litre. And if you are running it in the city and a highway mixed, it will give you 20 kilometers 
	         per litre. So these answers the salesman might give you when you ask about the performance of the car. 
	         
	         - Highway (Minimum Traffic) --> 25 km/litre
	         - City + Highway (Average Traffic) --> 20 km/litre
	         - City (Maximum Traffic) --> 15 km/litre	         
	         
	         So when we talk an algorithm, these asymptotic notations gives us this rough idea of how an algorithm will be performing 
	         in certain situations. So here, Asymptotic Notations help us in determining:
	         
	         - Best Case
	         - Average Case
	         - Worst Case
	         
	         So we can simply relate this analogy to these conditions the best case would be that if you are driving on a highway,
	         the average case would be that you are driving in both city and highway. The worst case would be that if you are driving 
	         in city. So this is how Asymptotic Notations provide us an in-depth description about the running of time of an algorithm
	         in terms of it's input size.
